### About

I completed my undergraduate study in Businese Management(Pharmaceutical track) at [China Pharmaceutical University](https://en.cpu.edu.cn/) in 2019. Now I am a MS student in Biostatistics(Theory and Methods track) at [Columbia University](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/departments/biostatistics). I am interested in data science and programming in R and python. I love playing with codes and use what I know for some goofy funny stuff.

I spent 4 years in business school at China Pharmaceutical University, where I was trained to think critically and utilize quantitative skills in real world problems. Economics and operation research course experience had give me the capability to think and tackle problems quantitively and logially. In course statistics principles, I was able to find the beauty of programming, which inspired me into getting a master's degree where I can learn both statistical methods and programming skills. 

Now I am pursuing my master's degree in Biostatistics at Columbia University. I am interested in machine learning techniques and coding in solving real-world problems. More importantly, I believe in the power of real-world application and interpretation. My CV can be found above.
