### About

I completed my undergraduate study in Businese Management(Pharmaceutical track) at [China Pharmaceutical University](https://en.cpu.edu.cn/) in 2019. Now I am a MS student in Biostatistics(Theory and Methods track) at [Columbia University](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/departments/biostatistics). I am interested in data science and programming in R and python. I love playing with codes and use what I know for some goofy funny stuff.
