I spent 4 years in business school at China Pharmaceutical University, where I was trained to think critically and utilize quantitative skills in real world problems. Economics and operation research course experience had give me the capability to think and tackle problems quantitively and logially. In course statistics principles, I was able to find the beauty of programming, which inspired me into getting a master's degree where I can learn both statistical methods and programming skills. 

Then I started pursuing my master's degree in Biostatistics at Columbia University. I am interested in machine learning techniques and coding in solving real-world problems. 

After graduating from Columbia, I joined IQVIA in 2021 as an analyst in Data Science and Advanced Analytics.
